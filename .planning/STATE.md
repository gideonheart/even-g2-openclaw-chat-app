## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (20 entries with outcomes).

- Cascade delete uses raw IDB transaction with cursor for atomicity (10-01)
- SyncBridge feature-detects BroadcastChannel, falls back to localStorage (10-01)
- localStorage fallback uses set+remove pattern for repeated sends (10-01)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- BroadcastChannel support in flutter_inappwebview is unverified on real hardware (SYNC-02 fallback ready)
- IndexedDB durability in Even App WKWebView (iOS) may evict data under storage pressure
- Gateway text turn API for hub text input (HUB-03/04) not confirmed with backend
