### Blockers/Concerns

- BroadcastChannel support in flutter_inappwebview is unverified on real hardware (SYNC-02 fallback ready)
- IndexedDB durability in Even App WKWebView (iOS) may evict data under storage pressure
- Gateway text turn API for hub text input (HUB-03/04) not confirmed with backend
