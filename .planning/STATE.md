## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (20 entries with outcomes).

- Cascade delete uses raw IDB transaction with cursor for atomicity (10-01)
- SyncBridge feature-detects BroadcastChannel, falls back to localStorage (10-01)
- localStorage fallback uses set+remove pattern for repeated sends (10-01)
- switchToSession uses renderer.destroy()+init() cycle to clear display (10-02)
- SyncBridge initialized before Layer 1 hardware boundary for early sync readiness (10-02)
- Session events added to AppEventMap for local bus coordination (10-02)
- SessionManager wraps SessionStore + SyncBridge in single facade for all session ops (10-03)
- Removed hardcoded SESSIONS array; sessions loaded dynamically from IndexedDB (10-03)
- activeSession default '' (set from IndexedDB on boot), initHub() now async (10-03)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- BroadcastChannel support in flutter_inappwebview is unverified on real hardware (SYNC-02 fallback ready)
- IndexedDB durability in Even App WKWebView (iOS) may evict data under storage pressure
- Gateway text turn API for hub text input (HUB-03/04) not confirmed with backend
